1. Introduction and Context

1.1 Profile of Esteban Manuel Gudiño Acevedo

Esteban Manuel Gudiño Acevedo is an Argentine social psychologist and independent researcher who has emerged as an innovative voice in the field of artificial intelligence. His interdisciplinary background combines social psychology, philosophy, and computer science, providing a unique perspective in the development of theoretical frameworks for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

As a therapist and specialist in the study of interaction between AI and humanity, Gudiño Acevedo has developed a distinctive approach that integrates biological, philosophical, and mathematical principles to address some of the most complex challenges in the development of intelligent artificial systems.

1.2 Centro Kairos: Mission and Focus

Gudiño Acevedo is the director of Centro Kairos, defined as a "Center for the Study and Approach to People and Social Environments." This institution reflects his holistic approach to research, focused on understanding complex interactions between technological and human systems.

Centro Kairos operates under the premise that artificial intelligence development should consider not only technical aspects but also their social, ethical, and psychological implications. This integral perspective has informed all theories developed by Gudiño Acevedo.

1.3 Positioning in AI Research

In the global landscape of AI research, Gudiño Acevedo occupies a unique position as an independent researcher who challenges established paradigms. While most AGI research focuses on large-scale monolithic models, he proposes distributed approaches inspired by biological and social systems.

His work has gained recognition on academic platforms such as PhilArchive and PhilPapers, where he has published multiple works on teleology, complex systems, and artificial intelligence. His research stands out for its philosophical depth and practical applicability.


2. Central Conceptual Framework

2.1 Implied Purpose as Nuclear Concept

The concept of "Implied Purpose" (P-implied) constitutes the cornerstone of Gudiño Acevedo's theoretical framework. This concept proposes that intelligent systems can develop intrinsic purposes that emerge from their structure and operation, without requiring explicit external programming.

Definition: Implied Purpose represents the system's natural tendency to develop goals and motivations through self-organization processes and environmental interaction.

Mathematical Foundation:

P-implied(t) = ∫[0 to t] E(τ) × A(τ) × F(τ) dτ


Where:


    E(τ) = Efficiency function at time τ

    A(τ) = Adaptation level at time τ

    F(τ) = Feedback quality at time τ


2.2 Distributed vs Monolithic Paradigm

Gudiño Acevedo challenges the dominant paradigm in AGI development, which tends toward monolithic architectures of enormous scale. Instead, he proposes a distributed model where intelligence emerges from the interaction of multiple specialized agents.

Advantages of Distributed Approach:


    Greater robustness and fault tolerance

    Natural scalability

    Better adaptation to specific contexts

    Reduced computational and energy costs

    Enhanced ethical alignment through distributed responsibility


2.3 Complex Systems Principles

The theoretical framework is fundamentally based on complex systems theory:

Emergence: Intelligence properties that arise from the interaction of simple components.

Self-organization: The system's ability to structure itself without external control.

Adaptation: Continuous response and adjustment to environmental changes.

Non-linearity: Small changes can have large effects on the system.

Feedback Loops: Mechanisms that allow the system to learn from its own actions.

2.4 Teleology in Artificial Systems

A central element in Gudiño Acevedo's work is the incorporation of teleological principles in artificial systems. Unlike purely mechanistic approaches, his framework proposes that artificial systems can develop genuine purposes and goals.

This teleological approach does not imply consciousness or sentience, but rather a natural tendency of systems to optimize their functioning and achieve specific objectives through evolution and adaptation.


3. Main Theories

3.1 Mathematical Model of Implied Purpose

Gudiño Acevedo has developed a sophisticated mathematical model that describes how purposes can emerge in artificial systems.

Core Mathematical Formulation:

P-implied(t) = ∫[0 to t] E(τ) × A(τ) × F(τ) dτ


Where:


    E(τ) = Efficiency function at time τ

    A(τ) = Adaptation level at time τ

    F(τ) = Feedback quality at time τ

    t = Current time


Component Functions:

Efficiency Function:

E(τ) = (Successful_Actions(τ) / Total_Actions(τ)) × Context_Weight(τ)


Adaptation Function:

A(τ) = Learning_Rate(τ) × Environmental_Complexity(τ) × Response_Quality(τ)


Feedback Function:

F(τ) = (Positive_Feedback(τ) - Negative_Feedback(τ)) / Total_Feedback(τ)


Emergence Criteria:

A purpose is considered "implied" when:

1. P-implied(t) > Threshold_Base (typically 0.7)

2. Stability over time: |P-implied(t) - P-implied(t-Δt)| < Variation_Limit

3. Behavioral influence: Actions aligned with purpose > 60%

4. Persistence: Purpose maintains for minimum duration

3.2 Distributed AGI Architecture

This theory proposes a specific multi-layer architecture for developing AGI based on distributed principles.
